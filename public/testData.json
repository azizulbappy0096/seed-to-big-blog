In 1995, the 'Online Diary' on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty,_Inc.'>Ty, Inc.</a> Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available. Posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text based <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML'>HTML</a> code using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP'>FTP</a> software in real time several times a day. To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day. At the beginning of each new day, new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file, and the start of each month, diary entries were archived into its own folder which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month. Then menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site. This text-based method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-BeanieBabies-16'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p><p style='margin-left:0px;'>The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger and less technically-inclined population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of 'blogging'. Blogs can be hosted by dedicated <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_hosting_service'>blog hosting services</a>, on regular <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service'>web hosting services</a>, or run using blog software.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 style='margin-left:0px;'><strong>Rise in popularity</strong></h3><p style='margin-left:0px;'>After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:</p><ul><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Ableson'>Bruce Ableson</a> launched <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Diary'>Open Diary</a> in October 1998, which soon grew to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers' blog entries.</li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Fitzpatrick'>Brad Fitzpatrick</a> started <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal'>LiveJournal</a> in March 1999.</li><li>Andrew Smales created Pitas.com in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a 'news page' on a Web site, followed by DiaryLand in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-22'><sup>[22]</sup></a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)'>Evan Williams</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Hourihan'>Meg Hourihan</a> (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyra_Labs'>Pyra Labs</a>) launched <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger.com'>Blogger.com</a> in August 1999 (purchased by Google in February 2003)</li></ul><figure class='image'><img src='http://localhost:2000/images/upload-1631882736999.png'></figure><p style='margin-left:0px;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:0px;'>By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_consultant'>political consultants</a>, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean'>Howard Dean</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Clark'>Wesley Clark</a>.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)'>UK's Labour Party's</a> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)'>Member of Parliament</a> (MP) <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(Labour_politician)'>Tom Watson</a>, began to blog to bond with constituents. In January 2005, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)'><i>Fortune</i></a> magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people 'could not ignore': <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget'>Peter Rojas</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeni_Jardin'>Xeni Jardin</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Trott'>Ben Trott</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mena_Trott'>Mena Trott</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_I._Schwartz'>Jonathan Schwartz</a>, Jason Goldman, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble'>Robert Scoble</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis'>Jason Calacanis</a>.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-26'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p><p style='margin-left:0px;'>Israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-Ynet-27'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Under <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Saranga'>David Saranga</a>, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs'>Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> became active in adopting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0'>Web 2.0</a> initiatives, including an official <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_blog'>video blog</a><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-Ynet-27'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_blog'>political blog</a>.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-Ynet3-28'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The Foreign Ministry also held a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging'>microblogging</a> press conference via Twitter about its <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict'>war with Hamas</a>, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-JP-29'><sup>[29]</sup></a> The questions and answers were later posted on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsraelPolitik'>IsraelPolitik</a>, the country's official political blog.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-NYTs-30'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p><p style='margin-left:0px;'>The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments. In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area. Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government. U.S. President <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama'>Barack Obama</a> acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying 'if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding'.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-31'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Between 2009 and 2012, an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwell_Prize'>Orwell Prize</a> for blogging was awarded.</p>"
